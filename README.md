## Features

### Log Explorer

The Log Explorer feature allows you to retrieve and explore debug logs directly within Visual Studio Code. It eliminates the need to switch to external tools or the Salesforce web interface for log analysis. With Log Explorer, you can:

-   Search String Filtering: Utilize the search string filtering feature to narrow down the debug logs based on specific keywords or phrases. This allows you to quickly locate logs related to a particular issue or scenario, making troubleshooting more targeted and efficient.

-   Debug Only: Enable the "Debug Only" option to filter the debug logs specifically for the user's custom debug logs. This feature ensures that you view and analyze only the debug logs generated by your activities, providing a focused and streamlined debugging experience.
