# ForceBoost - Salesforce Developer Extension for Visual Studio Code

## Overview

ForceBoost is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the Salesforce developer experience, making it more efficient and productive. This extension provides various features to simplify the debugging process and streamline the retrieval of debug logs, allowing developers to focus on their code and troubleshoot with ease.

## Features

### Log Explorer

The Log Explorer feature allows you to retrieve and explore debug logs directly within Visual Studio Code. It eliminates the need to switch to external tools or the Salesforce web interface for log analysis. With Log Explorer, you can:

-   Search String Filtering: Utilize the search string filtering feature to narrow down the debug logs based on specific keywords or phrases. This allows you to quickly locate logs related to a particular issue or scenario, making troubleshooting more targeted and efficient.

-   Debug Only: Enable the "Debug Only" option to filter the debug logs specifically for the user's custom debug logs. This feature ensures that you view and analyze only the debug logs generated by your activities, providing a focused and streamlined debugging experience.

## Future Feature

### Anonymous Editor with Debug Log Filtering

Actively working on introducing an in-house Anonymous Editor with built-in debug log filtering capabilities. This feature will enable you to write and execute anonymous Apex code snippets within Visual Studio Code, enhancing your development workflow. You'll be able to analyze the debug logs of your anonymous Apex execution directly from the editor, allowing for quick identification of issues and effective debugging.
